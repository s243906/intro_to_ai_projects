# Intro to AI Projects

## Assignment 1: Kalaha
A simple implementation of the Kalaha game in Python. The game can be played in three modes:
1. Human vs Human
2. Human vs AI
3. AI vs Human 

The AI algorithm implemented is the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. There are three difficulty levels based on the number of iterations of the algorithms.

### How to play the game?
Navigate to the `assignment1/kalaha` directory and run the following command:
```
python main.py
```
